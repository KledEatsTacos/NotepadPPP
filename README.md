# Notepad+++

This is my first homework for my Object-Oriented Programming class. The program is a simple text editor app.

## Features
- Create and edit text files.
- Save and load text files.
- Basic text editing functionalities like cut, copy, and paste.

This project will probably put Notepad++ out of business.
